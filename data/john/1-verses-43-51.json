    "historicalContext": "From complete skepticism ('Can anything good come from Nazareth?') to full confession in one encounter. Nathanael uses two messianic titles: 'Son of God' (a royal title from Psalm 2:7, where God says to the anointed king 'You are my Son') and 'King of Israel' (the political hope of a Davidic ruler who would restore the nation). At this stage, Nathanael probably understands these as messianic titles rather than ontological claims about divinity — that understanding will deepen over three years.",

It didn't necessarily imply ontological divinity at this stage — it meant 'the anointed king who has a unique relationship with God.'

The phrase is deliberately ambiguous: it emphasizes both humanity ('son of man' = human being) and divine authority (Daniel's figure receives worship from all nations). The preposition epi (upon) is crucial — in Jacob's dream, the angels ascend and descend on the LADDER. Jesus replaces the ladder with himself. He IS the connection between heaven and earth. He IS the house of God. The entire access point between the human and the divine is a person.",

        "twistedExplanation": "Not twisted by translators, but widely misunderstood. Most readers assume 'Son of Man' emphasizes Jesus' humanity (as opposed to 'Son of God' which emphasizes divinity). In reality, 'Son of Man' from Daniel 7 is the MORE exalted title — it's the figure who rides the clouds (a divine prerogative), receives worship from all nations, and rules an everlasting kingdom. Jesus chose this title precisely because it contained both his humanity and his cosmic authority in one phrase."
