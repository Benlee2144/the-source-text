  "author": "John (Ἰωάννης / Yohanan — 'God is gracious'), son of Zebedee, one of the twelve apostles. Called 'the disciple whom Jesus loved.' Wrote this gospel late in life, likely from Ephesus around 85-95 AD — decades after Matthew, Mark, and Luke. By this time, the Temple had been destroyed (70 AD), Christianity had separated from Judaism, and Greek philosophical concepts like Logos were common in the culture John was writing to.",
  "audience": "Written primarily to Greek-speaking believers and seekers in Asia Minor (modern Turkey). Unlike Matthew (written for Jews) or Luke (written for Romans), John writes for people familiar with Greek philosophical concepts. This is why he opens with 'Logos' — a term Greek philosophers had debated for 600 years. He's meeting his audience where they are and saying 'that thing you've been searching for? He has a name.'",
  "historicalContext": "By the time John writes, the other three gospels have been circulating for 20-30 years. John doesn't repeat their material much — he includes things they left out and goes deeper theologically. The early church father Clement of Alexandria called John 'the spiritual gospel.' Rome has destroyed Jerusalem. Christians are being persecuted. Gnostic heresies are emerging — groups claiming Jesus wasn't truly human, or that the physical world is evil. John writes to counter these directly: 'The Word became FLESH' (1:14) is a direct shot at Gnosticism.",

His Greek audience would immediately recognize 'Logos' from Heraclitus and Stoic philosophy — the rational principle behind the universe. His Jewish audience would hear Genesis. John is saying: the Logos the Greeks have been theorizing about and the Creator God of Genesis are the same being.",

          "definition": "This is one of the richest words in all of Greek. Logos had been debated by philosophers for 600 years before John used it. Heraclitus (500 BC) used logos to describe the rational principle governing the universe — the invisible logic behind everything. The Stoics made it central to their philosophy — the divine reason permeating all reality. Jewish philosopher Philo of Alexandria used logos as the bridge between the transcendent God and the physical world. John takes ALL of these threads and drops a bomb: the Logos isn't an abstract principle. It's a PERSON. He walks, talks, bleeds, and has a name. John essentially says: 'That rational principle behind the universe that you philosophers have been theorizing about for six centuries? I had dinner with Him.'",
          "translationNote": "'Word' is the standard translation but it's severely limiting. In English, 'word' is just a unit of speech. Logos encompasses reason, logic, divine expression, creative power, the ordering principle of existence. There's no single English word that captures it. 'Word' was chosen because of the connection to God speaking creation into existence (Genesis 1 — 'God SAID let there be light'), but it loses the philosophical and cosmic dimensions.",
          "twisted": true,
          "twistedExplanation": "Not twisted intentionally, but 'Word' domesticates logos. Most English readers think 'word' = something you say.

The Word was FACING God — in eternal, intimate, face-to-face communion. This is John's first hint at the Trinity: the Word is distinct from God (face-to-face implies two parties) yet equal (you don't stand face-to-face with someone infinitely above you).",

In Greek grammar, this is called a predicate nominative without the article, which emphasizes the NATURE or QUALITY of the subject. John is saying the Word has the nature/essence of God — the Word is fully divine. This is not saying 'the Word was A god' (which would require the indefinite article, which Greek doesn't have, but would use different construction). This is also not saying 'the Word was THE God' (which would collapse the distinction established in the previous clause). It's saying: the Word possesses the full nature of deity. Distinct person. Same essence.",
          "translationNote": "English 'the Word was God' is accurate but the emphasis is lost. In Greek, putting theos first is like saying 'GOD — that's what the Word was.' The emphasis lands on the divine nature.",
          "twisted": true,
          "twistedExplanation": "Jehovah's Witnesses translate this as 'the Word was a god' in their New World Translation, arguing the lack of article before theos means it's indefinite. This is grammatically incorrect — Colwell's Rule in Greek grammar shows that predicate nominatives before the verb are typically anarthrous (without article) without being indefinite. Nearly every Greek scholar — secular and religious — rejects the JW translation. The grammar is clear: the Word is fully God in nature."

It comes from monos (only) + genos (kind, type, class) — meaning 'one of a kind, unique, the only one of its type.' The older derivation from gennaō (to beget) has been corrected by modern scholarship. Monogenēs means unique, not procreated. Isaac was called Abraham's monogenēs (Hebrews 11:17) even though Abraham had other sons (Ishmael). Isaac was the unique one — the promised one, the one-of-a-kind. Jesus isn't God's Son because God 'begat' Him in time. He's monogenēs — the utterly unique, one-of-a-kind Son. There is no other like Him. Para patros — 'from beside a Father' — the same intimate para from verse 6. From the Father's side.",
          "translationNote": "'Only begotten' is a famously problematic translation. It implies the Son was 'begotten' or produced at some point in time, which contradicts verse 1 (the Word was ALREADY existing in the beginning).

          "twistedExplanation": "'Only begotten' (KJV) led to the Arian heresy and Jehovah's Witness theology — the idea that the Son was 'begotten' (created/produced) by the Father at some point. But monogenēs means 'one-of-a-kind,' not 'only-produced.' The Son is unique, not manufactured. This single mistranslation has fueled more theological error than almost any other word in the Bible. Modern scholarship overwhelmingly supports 'one and only' or 'unique' as the correct translation."

GOD. This is the strongest declaration of Christ's deity in the entire prologue. Scribes likely changed theos to huios because calling Jesus 'the unique God' felt too bold, or to harmonize with John 3:16 which uses monogenēs huios. But the harder reading (theos) is almost certainly original — scribes don't make texts MORE provocative, they soften them.",

The original reading makes the strongest possible claim: the one who explains God IS God. The KJV's 'only begotten Son' is based on inferior manuscripts AND mistranslates monogenēs (see verse 14 notes)."

When God renamed Jacob to 'Israel,' it marked a transformation from deceiver to one who wrestles honestly with God. Jesus is saying: 'Here is a descendant of Jacob who actually lives up to the name Israel — an honest wrestler with God, not a deceiver.'",

The preposition epi (upon) is crucial — in Jacob's dream, the angels ascend and descend on the LADDER. Jesus replaces the ladder with himself. He IS the connection between heaven and earth. He IS the house of God. The entire access point between the human and the divine is a person.",
          "translationNote": "'Son of Man' is technically accurate but modern readers miss the Daniel 7 background. It sounds like 'a human' when it actually means 'the divine-human figure who will rule forever.' This is possibly the most misunderstood title in the Bible.",
          "twisted": true,
          "twistedExplanation": "Not twisted by translators, but widely misunderstood. Most readers assume 'Son of Man' emphasizes Jesus' humanity (as opposed to 'Son of God' which emphasizes divinity). In reality, 'Son of Man' from Daniel 7 is the MORE exalted title — it's the figure who rides the clouds (a divine prerogative), receives worship from all nations, and rules an everlasting kingdom. Jesus chose this title precisely because it contained both his humanity and his cosmic authority in one phrase."
