  "historicalContext": "John 4 records Jesus' journey through Samaria, a region Jews typically avoided by crossing the Jordan and traveling through Perea. The deep hostility between Jews and Samaritans dated back to the Assyrian deportation of 722 BC and was intensified when the Samaritans built a rival temple on Mount Gerizim around 400 BC, which the Jewish leader John Hyrcanus destroyed in 128 BC. Jesus' deliberate choice to pass through Samaria and engage a Samaritan woman — doubly scandalous given her gender and ethnic identity — signals the universal scope of His mission. The chapter also features a royal official (basilikos) from Capernaum, likely connected to Herod Antipas' court, showing Jesus' reach across social boundaries.",

      "historicalContext": "The official traveled roughly 20 miles from Capernaum (on the Sea of Galilee, below sea level) up to Cana in the hills. 'Come down' (καταβῇ) reflects the geography — Capernaum sits about 680 feet below sea level. The father's request assumes Jesus must be physically present to heal, a limitation Jesus will deliberately challenge.",
