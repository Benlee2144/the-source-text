  "author": "John (Ἰωάννης / Yohanan — 'God is gracious'), son of Zebedee, one of the twelve apostles. Called 'the disciple whom Jesus loved.' Wrote this gospel late in life, likely from Ephesus around 85-95 AD — decades after Matthew, Mark, and Luke.",
  "audience": "Greek-speaking believers and seekers in Asia Minor (modern Turkey), familiar with both Jewish theology and Greco-Roman philosophy.",
  "historicalContext": "John 9 records the healing of a man born blind — the only such miracle in all four gospels. This event occurs during or near the Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot), when massive candelabras lit up the Temple courts. Jesus had just declared 'I am the light of the world' (8:12), and now He proves it by giving light to eyes that never had it. The chapter is a masterpiece of irony: the blind man progressively sees more clearly (physically and spiritually) while the Pharisees become progressively more blind. The narrative also reflects the tension between the early church and the synagogue — the threat of expulsion (ἀποσυνάγωγος, 9:22) mirrors what Jewish Christians were experiencing when John wrote. The Birkat haMinim (a benediction against heretics added to synagogue liturgy ~85 AD) was being used to identify and expel Christ-followers.",
